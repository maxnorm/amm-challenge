Do not change the Foundry configuration (e.g. foundry.toml, remappings, compiler settings like via_ir, optimizer, solc version, evm_version).

We do not control the simulation environment. The build and run environment (including amm-match) uses the project’s existing config; changing it can break local or remote builds and simulations.

If you hit stack-too-deep or other compiler limits, fix the strategy code (e.g. split logic into more private/view helpers, use temp slots) instead of modifying foundry.toml or compiler options.
